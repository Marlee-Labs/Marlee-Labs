# Hey Marlee!
(not my name, only the one of the project)

## Who am I?
Hello, I am...
* ...the developer of the Marlee project. Yes, the only one. ;)
* ...still a student, thus the slow project.
* ...from Germany, so I know how bad technology at schools is. Time to improve that.
* ...a huge fan of standardized (file) formats and open source projects.

## What is "Marlee"?
Marlee is (uhm... well... it will be) some kind of office suite.
I plan to create applications for
* processing text (.odt, ...) I have to do some research on that topic.
* handwriting (maybe .svg) as used by <a href="https://github.com/Styluslabs">StylusLabs<\a>'s Write
* presentations (.odp) I am scared by that, but I am by far not there...
* spreadsheets (.ods) I am looking forward to this. I like implementing logic (wich is in there, I guess... rarely use them)
* images/graphics (.odg, all "common" image formats: png, ...)

That is a lot of work.
I am a studend.
Don't expect too much.
But expect something... someday...

## What am I currently working on?
Honestly, I am still at the beginning:
Currently I am working on "<a href="https://github.com/Marlee-Labs/MarleeLib">MarleeLib"</a>, the base library of all the following programms. But yet, I am not sure on how to properly render things and going still to school, I may not have lots of time. I'll do my best though.

## What I plan todo:
